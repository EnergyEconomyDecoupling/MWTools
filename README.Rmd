# MWTools

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MWTools is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EnergyEconomyDecoupling/MWTools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MWTools)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r get_example_data, echo=FALSE}
all_data <- calc_amw_pfu(data_folder = file.path(PFUSetup::get_abs_paths()$project_path, "Data", "FAO Data"),
                         amw_analysis_path = file.path(PFUSetup::get_abs_paths()$project_path, "Muscle work\\amw_master_data.xlsx"))

all_numbers <- calc_amw_numbers(data_folder = file.path(PFUSetup::get_abs_paths()$project_path, "Data", "FAO Data"),
                                amw_analysis_path = file.path(PFUSetup::get_abs_paths()$project_path, "Muscle work\\amw_master_data.xlsx"))
                                
                                
```

Use the `plot_amw_summary` function to produce a plot summarising the animal muscle work data for a particular country and sector.

```{r example_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=7}

plot_amw_summary(amw_pfu_df = all_data,
                 amw_numbers_df = all_numbers,
                 country = "CHN",
                 sector = "Total")

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
